Short Description:  The objective of this game is to click the moving Toad to gather coins. He makes noises based off your                     actions. If you click away from Toad, you will lose coins. The timer is in place so that you may time                     yourself to see how many coins you can get in a certain amount of time.

This code requires the Python version 2.7.6 along with the graphics library pygame 1.9.1 source and use homebrew to install packages for pygame onto Macintosh (http://pygame.org/download.shtml).

To run the command in cmd, type python2.7-32 ShroomClicker.py
